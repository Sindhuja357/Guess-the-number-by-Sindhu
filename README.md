# Guess-the-number-by-Sindhu

A simple console-based Python script for a Number Guessing Game. The player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

## Description

This Python script prompts the player to enter their name, generates a random number, and allows the player to guess the number within a limited number of tries. After each guess, the script provides feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number or exceeds the maximum number of allowed guesses.
